# AdaQual-Diff🚀  
*Diffusion-Based Image Restoration via Adaptive Quality Prompting*

---

## 🌿 Introduction

[AdaQual-Diff] is a novel diffusion framework for image restoration that dynamically integrates perceptual quality assessment into the generative process. Leveraging **Adaptive Quality Prompting**, AdaQual-Diff allocates computational attention proportionally to local degradation severity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both composite and adverse weather degradations.

Our framework establishes a direct mathematical relationship between spatial quality scores and guidance complexity, enabling fine-grained, region-specific restoration without increasing model parameters or inference steps.

AdaQual-Diff not only advances the theoretical understanding of quality-aware diffusion guidance but also demonstrates practical efficiency with only 2 sampling steps and competitive inference speed.
